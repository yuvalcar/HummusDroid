HummusDroid
===========

Hummus locator and navigator.

HummusDroid (or just "חומוס" in Hebrew) is an application for 
locating and navigating to nearest Hummus places.

HummusDroid uses GooglePlaces API to find the nearest (~50km, sorted by proximity)
Hummus places, and activates Waze or Google navigation, according to user selection,
to the chosen Hummus place.

Enjoy your Hummus :)
